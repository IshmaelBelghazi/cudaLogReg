+ C_only: [[https://travis-ci.org/IshmaelBelghazi/gpuClassifieR][https://travis-ci.org/IshmaelBelghazi/gpuClassifieR.svg?branch=C_only]]

* What's new
+ Added C-only branch. use install_github("IshmaelBelghazi/gpuClassifieR", ref="C_only")
+ Benchmark against glmnet. [[misc/test.md][In misc/test.md]]
* Prerequisites

1. A CUDA enabled gpu with compute capabilities 2.0 or above
2. CUDA toolkit 5.5 or above (although the package was only tested with 6.5)

* Installation Instructions

1. Be sure to have a CUDA_HOME environment variable defined. Typically its
   value would be CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-M-m/. Where M and m refer to the
   Major and minor version number respectively.
2. Add CUDA_HOME/lib64 to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. i.e: Typically export
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-M-m/lib64 (or lib if on 32bit system)
3. Use devtools::install_github("IshmaelBelghazi/gpuClassifieR")

* Status

+ Build: the package builds successfully. Tested on Ubuntu 14.10 x64 and
  travis (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x64)
+ Installation: The package installs successfully using
  devtools::install_github() or R CMD BUILD followed by R CMD INSTALL.
+ Check: The package fails R CMD check. This seems to a common problem with
  packages containing CUDA code and using nvcc. Even packages currently on
  CRAN (such as gputools and wideLM) do no pass the check. Still, the package does
  pass R CMD INSTALL --fake. If you know how to deal with this, please let me know.

This package was built on Ubuntu 14.10 x64 with CUDA toolkit 6.5.
