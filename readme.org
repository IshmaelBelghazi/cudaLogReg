#+TITLE: gpuClassifieR - C/CUDA Linear Classifier for R
#+AUTHOR: Mohamed Ishmael Diwan Belghazi
#+EMAIL: ishmael.belghazi@ipsolcapital.com


* Prerequisites

1. A CUDA enabled gpu with compute capabilities 2.0 or above
2. CUDA toolkit 5.5 or above (although it was only tested with 6.5)

* Installation Instructions

1. Be sure to have a CUDA_HOME environment variable defined. Typically its
   value would be CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-M-m/. Whew M and m refer to the
   Major and minor version number respectively.
2. Use devtools::install_github("IshmaelBelghazi/gpuClassifieR")


* Status

+ Build: the package builds successfully. Tested on Ubuntu 14.10 x64 and
  travis (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x64)
+ Installation: The package installs successfully using the
  devtools::install_github()
+ Check: The package fails R CMD check. This is seems to a common problem with
  all package containing CUDA code and using nvcc. Even package currently on
  CRAN (such as gputools and wideLM) do no pass the check. The package does
  pass R CMD install --install=fake. If any one knows how to deal with this
  please contact me.

This package was build on ubuntu 14.10 with CUDA toolkit 6.5.
